/*
Short circuit evaluation skips evaluating later operands if the result of the logical operator can already be determined. 
 - The logical AND operator short circuits to false if the first operand evaluates to false, 
and skips evaluating the second operand. 
 - The logical OR operator short circuits to true if the first operand is true,
 and skips evaluating the second operand.
